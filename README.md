Stethoscope is a web application that collects information from existing device data sources (e.g.,
JAMF or LANDESK) on a given userâ€™s devices and gives them clear and specific recommendations for
securing their systems. An overview is available on the [Netflix Tech
Blog](http://techblog.netflix.com/2017/02/introducing-netflix-stethoscope.html).

## Quickstart

If you have [node] (version 6.4+) and npm (included with node) installed already and just want to play around with the front end, run:

`make install-develop-ui`


## What is Stethoscope?

### Main Features

- Retrieves device information from:
  - JAMF
  - LANDESK
  - G Suite (Google) Mobile Management
  - bitFit
- Evaluates status of various security practices, including:
  - Disk encryption
  - Firewall
  - Screen saver lock/password
  - Operating system up-to-date
  - Operating system auto-update
  - Not jailbroken/rooted
  - Software presence (e.g., for monitoring tools)
- Merges associated device records
- Plugin architecture:
  - Easy to add data sources, practices, and other components
  - Examples and base plugins for communicating with Elasticsearch and HTTP REST APIs

## Getting Started

Stethoscope consists of two primary pieces: a Python-based back-end and a React-based front-end.
Nginx is used to serve static files and route traffic to the back-end.

The easiest way to get up-and-running quickly is through the provided Docker configuration.

### Docker

To run with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), first install Docker
([standard](https://docs.docker.com/mac/) or [beta](https://beta.docker.com/)).

We have provided a [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) file, `docker-compose.yml`,
that defines the services that make up Stethoscope. To start these services, run:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

Then connect to the main Nginx web server at `http://localhost:5000`.

#### Troubleshooting

If you encounter the following error, you likely need to upgrade `docker-compose` to version 1.10 or
higher.

> ERROR: In file './docker-compose.yml' service 'version' doesn't have any configuration options.
> All top level keys in your docker-compose.yml must map to a dictionary of configuration options.
